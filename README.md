# Aarden
##Introduction
--------
<p>You can not have a solution without there first being a problem. Let me start over, Aarden is a solution to problems that I as a developer and so many like myself have experienced with programming languages, it is that they are too *technical*. 
The implementation of language should be simple, just like the foundation of programmers knew from the 1950s that people can not talk binary, so they developed  languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer.<p>

<p> *Aarden* is a JavaScript extension library, which provides a familiar coding interface, for both client side and server side platforms that run JavaScript.<p>

<p>It provides the user with the tools to intuitively communicate with APIs, devices or databases. *Aarden* gives you adaptors that are available on any platform you are running. The *Aarden* language is a lot more simplified and intuitive. And as such it allows you to think more simplistic about the solutions for any problems that you may face when programming.<p>

<p> simply put *Aarden* simplifies programming, it is a design pattern that can be incorporated with any computer language to give you a small set of words to use to describe any project.<p>

###Orientation
-----------

<p> *Aarden* has 12 functions "Select, Global, Remove, Update, Insert, Render, Driver..." And with just these functions you can do a lot, I would say what these 12 functions are is an evolution of programming, a way of letting language flow in the context you want it to flow in. Moreover *Aarden* has a Core that is defined in medium. What Medium is, is a collection of methods, and this is where the power of this software comes from. These *sensor* functions use  methods in medium that have been assigned to them.<p>
